    Conformer convolution module starts with a pointwise convolution and a gated linear unit (GLU).
    This is followed by a single 1-D depthwise convolution layer. Batchnorm is  deployed just after the convolution
    to aid training deep models.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input
        kernel_size (int or tuple, optional): Size of the convolving kernel Default: 31

    Inputs: inputs
        inputs (batch, time, dim): Tensor contains input sequences

    Outputs: outputs
        outputs (batch, time, dim): Tensor produces by conformer convolution module.
