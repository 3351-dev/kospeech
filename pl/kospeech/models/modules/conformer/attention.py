class MultiHeadedSelfAttentionModule(nn.Module):
    """
    Conformer employ multi-headed self-attention (MHSA) while integrating an important technique from Transformer-XL,
    the relative sinusoidal positional encoding scheme. The relative positional encoding allows the self-attention
    module to generalize better on different input length and the resulting encoder is more robust to the variance of
    the utterance length. Conformer use prenorm residual units with dropout which helps training
    and regularizing deeper models.

    Args:
        d_model (int): The dimension of model
        num_heads (int): The number of attention heads.
        dropout_p (float): probability of dropout

    Inputs: inputs, mask
        - **inputs** (batch, time, dim): Tensor containing input vector
        - **mask** (batch, 1, time2) or (batch, time1, time2): Tensor containing indices to be masked

    Returns:
        - **outputs** (batch, time, dim): Tensor produces by relative multi headed self attention module.
